summary = "At Microsoft Research, I worked on FlashProg, a programming-by-example system that allows users to perform data wrangling using programming-by-example techniques, such as FlashFill and FlashExtract. Later, we deployed Flash Fill and Flash Extract to Windows 10 as Powershell commands: Convert-String and ConvertFrom-String, respectively. The success of these tools led to the creation of Microsoft Prose, a program synthesis framework, and FlashProg is now called Microsoft Prose Playground."
