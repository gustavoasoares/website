summary = "My current research focuses on learning program transformations from examples. Refazer (rebuild, in Portuguese) is technique for automatically learning program transformations. It builds on the observation that code edits performed by developers can be used as input-output examples for learning program transformations. Example edits may share the same structure but involve different variables and subexpressions, which must be generalized in a transformation at the right level of abstraction. To learn transformations, Refazer leverages state-of-the-art programming-by-example techniques."
