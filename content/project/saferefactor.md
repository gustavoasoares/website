summary = "In my PhD thesis, I propose a technique to test Java refactoring engines. It automates test input generation by using a Java program generator that exhaustively generates programs for a given scope of Java declarations. The refactoring under test is applied to each generated program. The technique uses SAFEREFACTOR, a tool for detecting behavioral changes, as oracle to evaluate the correctness of these transformations. The technique was useful for finding more than 100 bugs in Eclipse JDT, NetBeans and the JastAdd Refactoring Tools."
