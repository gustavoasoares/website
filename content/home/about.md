# Biography

I am an assistant professor at Federal University of Campina Grande - [Department of Computing Systems](http://www.computacao.ufcg.edu.br/), Brazil. I am member of [Software Productivity Group (SPG)](http://www.dsc.ufcg.edu.br/~spg/), SPLAB and Embedded Lab. In 2016, I joined the [Berkeley Institute of Design](http://bid.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley to work with [Bjoern Hartmann](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern/) on the [ExCAPE](https://excape.cis.upenn.edu/index.html) project as a visiting researcher.

I completed my Ph.D. under supervision of [Rohit Gheyi](http://www.dsc.ufcg.edu.br/~rohit/Rohit_Gheyi/Home.html) at Federal University of Campina Grande in 2014. During my Ph.D., I worked for three months with [Emerson Murphy-Hill](http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/ermurph3/) in the Developer Liberation Front at North Carolina State University. I also went through an internship at [Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/redmond/) under supervision of [Sumit Gulwani](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/sumitg/).

I am interested in developing programming synthesis techniques and tools to help developers, students, and end users.
